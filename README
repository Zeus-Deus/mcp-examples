# MCP Examples

This repository contains examples for using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with different AI models and tools.

## What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard (initially released by Anthropic in 2024) that defines a universal way for AI models to connect with external data sources, tools, and environments. Think of it as a "USB-C port for AI applications"â€”it standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs), making it much easier to connect models to real-world data and services without building custom integrations for every tool or content source.

For more information, see [Anthropic's announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) or the [MCP introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).
